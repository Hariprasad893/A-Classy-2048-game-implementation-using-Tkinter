# A-Classy-2048-game-implementation-using-Tkinter
This is an implementation of the 2048 game using Python. The Tkinter library, which is the most commonly used Python library for generating a Graphical User Interface (GUI) is used.

The 2048 game is a simple numbers game, wherein the player has to obtain the number 2048 in a standard grid of 4x4 size. The player is allowed to make a move in four possible directions: 1) Up, 2) Down, 3) Left and 4) Right. The game begins with two 2's randomly positioned in the grid, the player has to maneuver around to merge cells having the same number (which are multiple's of 2), as the maneuvering is done, 2's turn to 4, 4 turns to 8 and so on. The ultimate goal for the player is to build the numbers such that at least one cell contains number 2048. If the player is successful in doing so, he/she wins the game. But if the player fails to generate 2048 and all the cells in the grid are full and there is no possibilty of any more maneuvers, then the player loses the game.
